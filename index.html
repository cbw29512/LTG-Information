                        <li>Provide students and fresh graduates flexible internships using a working technical company's business model.</li>
                            <li>Our company model possesses a 4 tier "Job" system that allows interns to move weekly within every job inside the business.</li>
                                <li>Our "No commitment contract" means that interns can look for a job without fear during the internship.</li>

                                        <li>We only ask the intern to devote ten hours a week (while in the program) and be available for meetings on Monday and Friday via zoom or email.</li>

                    <li>Use the Prettier addon for VSC "on save" to ensure well organized code. Make sure if you add code, it makes the program look or function better without adding additonal bugs.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to include a comment above all code that you add to an existing program telling what it does.</li>
                            <li>When sure that when you commit you give a short explanation of anything you added or removed.</li>
                                <li>Remember: The goal of these projects are both for us to showcase our abilities and to show off to potential employeers. Keep this in mind when writing code or making visual changes.</li>
                                    <li>When in doubt ask someone! That's the entire purpose of The Real Light Tower Guild community, for us to grow stronger as developers with the support of our peers.</li>
                                        <li>If you break it, please fix it or remove the added code. If nothing else ask for help and let's see if we all can't learn from the experience!</li>
